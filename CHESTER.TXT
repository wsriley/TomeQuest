TELEPORT
GATE
TRANSPORT
The teleports are a hole in the fabric of reality allowing you
to traverse large distances in the blink of an eye! Place them
in convenient locations to further your quest. It takes
a clever man to free both from their ancient resting places.

ACID
SLIME
DRIP
The dripping green acid is all that remains of the numero-chemist Lyso
12Trips. He reduced himself to this ooze during a recreational

dis-concerting.

MAN
I am Chester The1 and I have walked with the Gods. Soon I shall join them in
the magical land of Dahz. I can not pass from this world to the hereafter
until I view the HolyTome of Ultimate Wisdom, the Neural Nector of Divinity,
so that I can know.

RIVER
GREEN
STREAM
The river divides the land of mortal numbers from the land of the divine.
This mystical green region was the earthly abode of our lords, Steve and Tom,
from where they defined the functions of the universe.
@
STEVE
TOM
GOD
It is rumored that Steve and Tom created this reality from their separate
place and that in truth the past we know may not have even been created
yet in their existence. And from the intermediate realm of Dahz they yield
the power to DELete our universe.

CASTLE
CITADEL
KEY
Each Castle was designed for a specific purpose. The Grey and Gold were built
by the Numerologists long ago to hold important artifacts. The Black castle
was designed by an evil wizard; it houses the devices and denizens of
disorder that guard the Tome.

The ancient lords used a flying machine to navigate the world they had
contrived. I believe that when they left this realm to return to Dahz they
left their machine on this plane. It could lie anywhere.

!END!
    Long ago in the land of
Dahz lived two powerful,
powerful men. They had at
their fingertips the power to
destroy entire universes no
matter how great or small.
Myriad creatures would spring
to life at Their command and
act on Their every whim. These
men were Gods. They were Steve
and Tom. Our world is one of
Their creations, our people
Their minions, our landscapes
and culture the products of
Their ever-flowing minds.
   There was a time when They
chose to walk among us,
surveying Their work, 'play-
testing' our world. A great
citadel was erected in which
Steve and Tom lived and worked
and They left scattered a
multitude of powerful magical
items: Teleport devices,
sorcerous stones, magical
potions, flying machines and
more. Our greatest numero-
philosophers were Their
lackeys and consorts including
myself and Iggy ad Infinitum.
This time marked the golden
age of our civilization, when
spectacular shrines were built
strongholds founded, and the
boundless numerological
energies of our people
channeled into the glorious
river of numbers... all in the
names of our Lords.
   But this age passed, as all
must, when one day Steve and
Tom entered into Their citadel
and were never seen again. As
one last blessing, though,
They left behind, in the care
of Their faithful servants
Iggy ad Infinitum and myself,
two gifts. Iggy was charged
with the care of the Powerful
Portable Hole, a portal to an
extra-dimensional world, while
I was given this, the well
spring of life, the source of
all knowledge: the HolyTome of
Ultimate Wisdom! We accepted
our gifts graciously, but my
compatriot felt cheated for I
had received the more powerful
prize, and he secretly coveted
it and schemed.
   Iggy built a massive grey-
stone castle, resplendent in
its spacious courtyard
inscribed with heroic slogans,
to house his gift from the
Gods. He guarded it with a
steep moat and puzzles of
logic while I, being of a
humble nature, elected to keep
the Tome with me in my hut.
This angered ad Infinitum for
he said I insulted Steve and
Tom with my simple treatment
of so great a gift and he
spoke openly of his disdain
for my behavior. As time went
on his jealousy grew and he
began acting against me in
secret.
   Iggy had amassed a
following of numero-
philosophers sympathetic to
his cause and together they
built a new castle, a castle
of the dark, deep beneath the
earth. This they guarded with
fire, snakes and the Temporal
Maze whose layout defied  all
natural laws. They lay down a
pathway that snaked and
twisted through magically
darkened caverns and sealed
off the only entrance at the
mighty gated mouth of a cave.
This was to be the eternal
resting place of the HolyTome
of Ultimate wisdom; a fit and
sturdy place, far better
suited to the task than a hut
of thatch and mud.
   One night, while I dreamt,
Iggy crept into my hut and
stole the Tome away! With all
speed he ferreted off his
prize, deep beneath the earth,
past all his denizens of the
dark, to the centerpiece of
his castle of black: the
sanctuary and final resting
place of the HolyTome of
Ultimate Wisdom. With a cry of
praise to the Gods Iggy lay
the grimoire on the altar and
threw back the cover. He cast
his gaze upon the open Tome
and... POOF! He burst into a
million tiny bits to be cast
forever onto the winds of
time. It seems our Lords had
intended the Tome for my eyes
only and they took no liking
to this upstart philosophers
blasphemous acts of revenge.
    So now, 1000 years after
it was rent from my grasp I
receive my gift again. I must
thank you, sweet barbarian,
for now I may die full and
sated with the knowledge of
our Lords of Dahz within me.
And you shant go unrewarded.
After my passing you may find
a hearty trove of treasure
deep beneath
!END!
